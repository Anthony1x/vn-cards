# vn-cards
Linux tool to mine anki cards, specifically made for visual novels, but can be used to mine anything.

Over time, this has grown to be a general purpose anki tool that can do all sorts of stuff.

## How to use

Rename/copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and redefine the variables to suit your setup.

Simply execute the `capture.sh [OPTION]` after creating a card.

To record audio, pass the `--record` flag. To stop recording audio, execute the script again (also with the `record` flag).

You could also use [this](https://github.com/Anthony1x/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/rofi/scripts/anki.sh) rofi script.

Personally I don't use the rofi script anymore since custom shortcuts to take screenshots and record audio respectively suffice for my usecase.

I've personally set it to `Meta+M` to take screenshots, and `Meta+Shift+M` to record audio.
[Qtile example](https://github.com/Anthony1x/.dotfiles/blob/a907525cab9111bc16c4123b6982cba7b4d64492/.config/qtile/keys.py#L21)

If unsure, refer to the source code, or ask me! I'm happy to help.

## Dependencies
* [scrot](https://github.com/dreamer/scrot) to take screenshots
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/) because that's what I used to write this script (:
* [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) - I didn't bother to implement PulseAudio support
* Of course, you also need [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)

Whilst I have adjusted the repository to work on mulitple setups, I wrote this script for myself first and foremost, so it's not tested to work on a plethora of systems.

Still, feel free to open an issue if something doesn't work the way you expect.

This repository wouldn't exist without these two, so thank you for making my life on linux significantly easier.
